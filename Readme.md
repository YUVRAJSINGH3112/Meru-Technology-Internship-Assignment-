- Protected Routes
- Invoice Creation
- Dashboard View
- Secure API Integration
- Clean UI using Tailwind + shadcn/ui

🙏 Note to the Reviewer

I would like to respectfully mention that I came across this internship assignment on the 18th, while the submission deadline was on the 19th. This gave me approximately one day to design, develop, and structure the entire project.

Due to the limited time, I focused primarily on implementing the core functionality and strictly following all the technical guidelines mentioned in the assignment. As a result, some parts of the UI may not be as polished as I would ideally like them to be. Additionally, while the codebase may not be perfectly refined in every area, it has been written in a clear, structured, and readable manner so that it can be easily refactored and improved further.

I genuinely put my best effort into building a functional, secure, and properly structured full-stack application within the available timeframe.

I am highly motivated and genuinely interested in this internship opportunity. It would mean a lot to me to be considered. I am confident that given the opportunity, I can further improve, refine, and contribute effectively.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
